# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web-based Flutter application. It has been migrated from a multi-platform (including Android) project to a web-only project. The goal is to create a modern, responsive, and visually appealing web application.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Current State (as of migration to web-only)

*   **Platform:** Web-only.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `cloud_firestore`
    *   `firebase_core`
    *   `firebase_database`
    *   `firebase_storage`
    *   `fl_chart`
    *   `go_router`
    *   `google_fonts`
    *   `image_picker`
    *   `intl`
    *   `provider`
    *   `table_calendar`
    *   `url_launcher`
    *   `device_calendar`
*   **Assets:**
    *   `assets/flyers/`

### Design Principles

*   **Modern Aesthetics:** The application will have a modern look and feel, incorporating Material Design 3 principles.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The UI will be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** `go_router` will be used for a declarative and intuitive navigation experience.
*   **Rich Visuals:** `fl_chart` will be used for data visualization, and `google_fonts` for beautiful typography.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Refine the application for a web-only experience.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Ensure the project is correctly configured for web-only development.
    2.  Review and refactor the existing codebase to optimize for web performance and user experience.
    3.  Implement any new features as requested by the user.
    4.  Deploy the application to Firebase Hosting.
